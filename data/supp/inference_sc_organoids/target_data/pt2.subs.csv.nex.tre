>      Of 82195 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        6 characters are constant (proportion = 7.29971e-05)
>        15841 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative

>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 50
>    Starting seed = generated automatically
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8

>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
