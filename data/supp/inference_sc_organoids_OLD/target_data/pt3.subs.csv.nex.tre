>      Of 49109 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        18202 characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 30907
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"

>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 50
>    Starting seed = generated automatically
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1

>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
